# Screen Capture and Text Recognition App

This project is a Python application that automates screen capturing, text recognition. It is designed to detect specific text on the screen, capture a predefined region, extract text from images, and organize the results into a text file.

---

## Features

1. **Automated Screen Capturing**:
   - Captures defined area (specified by user input)
   - Detects duplicate consecutive screenshots to determine the end of a sequence.

2. **Text Recognition with OCR**:
   - Uses Tesseract OCR to identify text in images.

3. **Region-Based Screen Capture**:
   - Saves captured regions to a specified folder for further processing.

4. **Text Extraction**:
   - Extracts text from captured images.
   - Combines all extracted text into a single file.

5. **Keyboard Automation**:
   - Simulates key presses (e.g., turning pages) to automate navigation during the process.
